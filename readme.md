# How to run the jupyter file and how to read pandas profiling

## Instruction on how to create environment to run this jupyter notebook
- Here we will use make of python virtual environment (venv), due to personal preference.
### First create a virtual environment with following command
python -m  venv tomtom_env 

### Then use requirements.text to install required library to run jupyter notebook
pip install -r requirements_1.txt

## The output of pandas-profiling is saved in a form of html
- Due to easy reading the output of the pandas-profiling is also saved in form of Html file
- file name is 'your_report.html'

### Note: In-case there are some issues in the setting up environment and running notebook
### Feel free to visit my github page --> https://github.com/javedhassans/tomtom_assig
### you can view the jupyter file there.
